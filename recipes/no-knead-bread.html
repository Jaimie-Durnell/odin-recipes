            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>My favorite no knead bread recipe is incredibly easy to make, 
                    perfectly crusty and golden on the outside, 
                    and soft and flavorful on the inside.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>3 1/4 cups strong white flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>             
                </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mix the dough.</strong> Stir together the flour, 
                        salt and yeast in a large mixing bowl until combined.  
                        Add in the warm water and stir with a <br>wooden spoon or spatula until the dough is 
                        evenly mixed and no large flour streaks remain.  
                        (The dough will look quite loose and shaggy,<br> which is ok.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Let the dough rise.</strong> Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or beeswrap, 
                        and let the dough rest at room temperature for 12 to 18 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shape the dough.</strong> Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface.  Fold the dough on top of itself — pulling the outer edges up and into the <br>center a few times until the dough feels a bit tighter and holds its shape — to form a round dough ball.  (If the dough is sticky or feels too <br>loose at any point, just keep sprinkling on extra flour as needed.)  Lightly flour the top of the dough ball, and then carefully flip it upside-<br>down onto a piece of parchment paper, so that the smooth side is on top.  Use your hands to shape the ball into an even circle.  Lightly flour <br>the top of the dough ball, then loosely cover it with plastic wrap or beeswrap to rest while the oven heats.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Heat the oven and Dutch oven.</strong> Place the Dutch oven inside of your oven*, then set oven to 450°F.  Wait for 20-30 minutes for the oven <br>to heat, while the dough continues to rest.  (If the dough rises and spreads out more than you would like during this time, just use your <br>hands to shape it into a tighter ball once more just before baking.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bake.</strong> Very carefully, use oven mitts to remove the Dutch oven from the oven.  (It will be extremely hot!)  Lift the edges of the parchment <br>to carefully transfer the dough ball (along with the parchment) to the Dutch oven.  Cover with the Dutch oven lid and bake for 30 minutes. <br>Then carefully remove the lid and bake for 10-20 more minutes, until the crust of the bread reaches your desired level of doneness (as <br>light or as deeply golden brown and crispy as you prefer).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Serve.</strong> Remove from the oven, uncover, and then carefully lift up the edges of the parchment to transfer the bread to a wire cooling rack. <br>Cool for at least 30 minutes, then slice, serve and enjoy!
                    </li>
